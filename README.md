# frontend-frameworks-list

The greatest list ever made on the internet of the most searched for, used, and popular front end frameworks to date.  This could be only pure CSS to full single page application frameworks all the way to icons.  This list will ever grow forever.  Depending on the project, depends on what you're going or wanting to use so choose wisely and continue to develope great front end projects!   If you don't see one here you like, add with a Pull request.  The original below are the ones that I have used and recommend.
